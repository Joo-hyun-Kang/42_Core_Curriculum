The US justice department is scheduled to ask a court on Tuesday to void the special master review examining documents seized from Donald Trumpâ€™s Mar-a-Lago residence and make the materials available to the criminal investigation surrounding the former president.
The hearing is particularly consequential for Trump: should he lose, it could mark the end of the special master process on which he has relied to delay, and gain more insight into, the investigation surrounding his potential mishandling of national security information.
